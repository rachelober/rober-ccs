          <li>
            I've been a member of the <a href= "http://acm.org/">National Association for Computing Machinery</a>
            since 2004 and an
            active member in Northeastern University's Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href= "http://acm.ccs.neu.edu/">nuACM</a>) since 2003. I was President in 2007-2008, Vice 
            President in 2006-2007 and Treasurer in 2004-2006.  
            I also taught a 3 week course in March of 2007 
            on <a href= "http://acm.ccs.neu.edu/?q=node/549">CSS, Javascript and XHTML basics</a>
            for nuACM's <a href="http://acm.ccs.neu.edu/?q=cpu">Co-op Preparation University</a>. nuACM does a lot, <a href= "http://acm.ccs.neu.edu/?q=calendar">check out our calendar</a>!
          </li>
          <li>
            I was also involved with the <a href= "http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/">CCIS Volunteer
              Systems Group (Crew)</a>
            and in the creation of 
            college podcast called NurdRadio. There are  
            also various <a href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/wiki/?ProjectsList">other projects</a>
            going on. I was 
            also a student representative to the <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa05/">LISA '05</a>
            convention in San Diego in December of
            2005.

            I have been 
            present at many welcome days and have been  
            featured in some promotional material. I was 
            also in a video called &ldquo;A Story in Eight  
            Voices&rdquo; which is available on the <a href= "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/undergraduate/video.html">CCIS website</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm also a member of the females in 
            computing group called <a href= "http://cisters.ccs.neu.edu/">CISters</a>. We
            do some fun stuff.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was a student teacher for <a href= "http://teachgroup.ccs.neu.edu/">Teachgroup</a>, 
            now known as the <a href= "http://www.northeastern.edu/nupr/news/0907/Bootstrap.html">Bootstrap</a>
            program at CCIS, during the 
            summer in 2005. We developed the curriculum and  
            then taught a class of Boston area 
            middle-schoolers how to program a game in <a href= "http://www.plt-scheme.org/">Scheme</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            My favorite language is <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>
            and I like working with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. I worked for <a href="http://www.merck.com/">Merck Research Laboratories</a>
            in the Longwood Medical area for my third co-op in 2007. I designed and implemented a database to house cell line information and then wrote a web interface using Ruby on Rails
            so that scientists could search the database and find pertinent information on that cell line.
